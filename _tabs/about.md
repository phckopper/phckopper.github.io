Hi! I'm Pedro, a young computer engineering student from southern Brazil. I'm currently finishing my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at [UFRGS](https://ufrgs.br). I also work at [Canonical](https://canonical.com) optimizing [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) for Intel platforms.
In the past, I've worked with embedded systems and electronics. I also have an electronics technician degree.

You can see my full profile at [my main page](https://kopper.dev).

Hope you enjoy! :)
