		<p>Hello, my name is Pedro.</p>
		<p>I'm 14 years old and live in Novo Hamburgo, Brazil. I've been studying computer programming and robotics since I was 9 years old. Since then, my life changed forever. Not only I learned a new thing, however I also learned how to see the world from other perspective. Instead of being a unsolveable puzzle, the world started to seem like a giant problem that could be solved using technology. I don't consider myself a programmer nor any other related thing. Instead, I consider myself a problem solver, trying to solve (some) og the world's problems.</p>
